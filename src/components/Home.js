                        <p className = 'description'>A theme park in Afghanistan was hijacked by the Taliban, with photos and videos of the militant group riding the park's attractions going viral on social media, N12 reported on Tuesday. 
                            Videos uploaded to Twitter earlier this week of the militant group received as many as 75,000 likes as of Wednesday morning. 
                            Between the conflicts of the streets in the capital Kabul, the Taliban fighters also found time to work out in the gym in the presidential headquarters and play sports. 
                            Others jumped on the trampoline and swayed on swings.</p>
